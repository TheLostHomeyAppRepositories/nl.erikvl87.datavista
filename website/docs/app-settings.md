# App Settings

The app settings provide access to all DataVista percentage and range values, along with stored visualizations. Each item shows a **Last updated** timestamp that helps with debugging and removing stale entries.

Gauge visualizations can be managed directly from this screen. Add new configurations or adjust existing ones—such as color stops and offsets—to fine-tune how your gauges render. The same visualizations can be configured through DataVista flow action cards when you prefer automation.
