# Progress Bar

The **Progress Bar** widget offers a minimal way to display percentage-based values such as battery level or capacity. Advanced users can supply percentages through DataVista action cards. Configure up to three colors to visualize low, medium, and high values with smooth transitions.

To use DataVista percentage or range values, run the corresponding DataVista action card at least once so the value appears in the widget settings list.

:::

:::warning
The **configuration source** requires a DataVista action card that defines colors and offsets. Run it once before selecting it in the widget settings. When used, it overwrites the manual color settings.

## FAQ

### Why does the bar animate through 0, 25, 50, 75, and 100?

The datasource is missing or unavailable. Reconfigure the datasource setting and select a valid source.

### How do I show a single color?

Select the same color for **Color 1** and **Color 2**.

### Why is the color list limited?

Homey widget settings do not support arbitrary color inputs, so the dropdown provides a curated set of options.

### Why do I see the device icon?

The widget displays the capability icon when available. If none is found, it falls back to the device icon.

### Why is there no icon?

Icons are currently available only for device capabilities. Ensure **Show icon** is enabled.
