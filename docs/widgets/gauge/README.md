# Gauge

The **Gauge** widget offers a visually dynamic way to display numerical data in the form of a gauge, making it ideal for tracking metrics like temperature, humidity, battery levels, or any other measurable value. The gauge provides an intuitive representation of your data, with customizable ranges and colors to match your specific needs.

There are two types of gauges available: the **Simple gauge** and the **Advanced gauge**. The **Simple gauge** can be fully configured through the widget settings, allowing you to easily adjust the value ranges, colors, and other visual elements. On the other hand, the **Advanced gauge** requires the use of **DataVista action cards** to configure both its data source and visual settings, offering more control and customization for advanced users.

## Configuring the _Simple_ gauge

The Simple Gauge widget offers more customization options but can be fully configured through the widget settings alone, making it the more straightforward choice. It includes the following configurable settings:

<table><thead><tr><th width="180">Setting</th><th width="549">Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Datasource</strong></td><td>Select a <em>device capability</em> to provide the value for the gauge. The widget will use its current value and, if available, the minimum and maximum values.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Number of segments</strong></td><td>Sets the number of segments on the gauge, with each segment's border displaying a value.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Refresh interval (seconds)</strong></td><td>The number of seconds to wait before polling for new values.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Minimum value</strong></td><td>Overrides the minimum value from the capability, defining the lowest point on the gauge.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Manual minimum value is negative</strong></td><td>This setting allows you to define a negative minimum value. The positive number entered will be treated as a negative value.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Maximum value</strong></td><td>Overrides the maximum value from the capability, defining the highest point on the gauge.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Manual maximum value is negative</strong></td><td>This setting allows you to define a negative maximum value. The positive number entered will be treated as a negative value.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Style</strong></td><td>Choose between <strong>Style 1</strong>, <strong>Style 2</strong>, or <strong>Circular</strong>. <br><br>Style 1 features a needle to indicate the value. Style 2 displays a colored bar showing the angle of the value. Circular presents a round gauge with a full 360° layout, giving a more traditional dial appearance.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Transparent background</strong></td><td>Choose whether the widget’s background is a solid color tile or transparent, blending seamlessly with the dashboard.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Color 1</strong></td><td>The color at the lowest point on the gauge.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Color 2</strong></td><td>The color at the middle on the gauge.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Color 3</strong></td><td>The color at the highest point on the gauge.</td></tr></tbody></table>

## Configuring the _Advanced_ gauge

The Advanced Gauge widget provides greater flexibility and customization but requires the use of action cards to configure both its data and visual settings, offering more control for advanced users. It includes the following configurable settings:

<table><thead><tr><th width="184">Setting</th><th width="551">Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Datasource*</strong></td><td>The <em>DataVista datasource</em> field, which can be of type range or percentage, providing the data for the advanced gauge.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Configuration source*</strong></td><td>The <em>DataVista configuration source</em>, which contains the gauge colors along with their respective offset settings.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Number of segments</strong></td><td>Sets the number of segments on the gauge, with each segment's border displaying a value.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Style</strong></td><td>Choose between Style 1 or Style 2. Style 1 features a needle, while Style 2 displays a colored bar indicating the angle of the value.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Transparent background</strong></td><td>Choose whether the widget’s background is a solid color tile or transparent, blending seamlessly with the dashboard.</td></tr></tbody></table>

\*The **datasource** requires a flow with a **DataVista action card** to configure either a percentage or range. This action card must be run at least once before the source can be selected in the widget settings.

## FAQ

### Why is the gauge animating in steps from 0, 25, 50, 75, and 100?

If the gauge is animating in steps from 0 to 25, 50, 75, and 100, and then back, it indicates that the datasource could not be found (or is no longer available). This typically happens when the selected datasource is removed. To resolve this issue, try reconfiguring the datasource setting and ensure the correct value is selected.

### How do I render a circular gauge?

To render a circular gauge, select **Circular** under the **Style** option in the widget settings. This style displays the gauge as a full 360° dial, providing a round and compact visual layout instead of a semi-circular one.
