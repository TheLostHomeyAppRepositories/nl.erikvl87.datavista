# Line chart

The **Line chart widget** in DataVista enables you to effortlessly compare two Homey insights in a single graph. This unique feature allows you to visualize and analyze the relationship between different data points, such as energy usage and temperature, side by side. With its intuitive design, the widget helps you uncover patterns and correlations, offering deeper insights into your Homey data.

Additionally, you can click on any data point within the chart to view more detailed information in a tooltip, providing a more granular look at the data for further analysis.

## Configuring the widget

The widget has the following configurable settings:

<table><thead><tr><th width="160">Setting</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Timeframe</strong></td><td>Determines the period for which data is displayed in the chart. Options include day, week, month, or year.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Datasource 1</strong></td><td>Choose a Homey insights source to display as the first data series in the chart. This will represent the primary data being visualized.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Period 1</strong></td><td>Specifies the period (this, previous, or rolling) to display for datasource 1, relative to the selected timeframe.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Color 1</strong></td><td>Sets the color for the data series associated with datasource 1, allowing you to distinguish it from datasource 2.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Overwrite name 1</strong></td><td>Allows you to overwrite the default name of the series for DataSource 1. This enables custom naming for better clarity.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Datasource 2</strong></td><td>Select a second Homey insights source to display as the second data series in the chart, allowing for comparison with the first datasource.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Period 2</strong></td><td>Specifies the period (this, previous, or rolling) to display for datasource 2, relative to the selected timeframe.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Color 2</strong></td><td>Sets the color for the data series associated with datasource 2, allowing you to distinguish it from datasource 1.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Overwrite name 2</strong></td><td>Allows you to overwrite the default name of the series for DataSource 2. This enables custom naming for better clarity.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Show Icon</strong></td><td>Enable to show the capability or device icon (if available), with priority given to the capability icon.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Show refresh countdown</strong></td><td>Option to show or hide the progress bar that indicates the time remaining until the chart refreshes with the latest data.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Y Axis Calculation Method</strong></td><td>Choose how the Y-axis range is calculated to determine if one or two Y-axes are required. Options include using the full range, applying the Interquartile Range (IQR) method, or forcing both series to share the same axis. This setting influences whether a second Y-axis is needed based on the range of the datasets.</td></tr></tbody></table>

## FAQ

### How can I show only the primary data source in the chart?

To display only the primary data source, simply leave datasource 2 unconfigured. Additionally, ensure that the period for datasource 2 (Period 2) is set to the same value as the period for datasource 1 (Period 1). This will ensure consistency in the chart and allow the primary data source to be visualized without the secondary data series.

### How can I compare the same data source for this period vs the previous?

To compare the same data source for the current period vs the previous one, leave datasource 2 empty. Then, set period 2 to a different period than period 1, such as selecting "this" for period 1 and "previous" for period 2. This will allow you to visualize the comparison between the two periods using the same data source.

### How does the "Y-Axis Calculation Method" setting affect the chart rendering?

The "Y-Axis Calculation Method" setting determines how the Y-axis range is calculated and helps decide whether one or two Y-axes are required.

* **Full Range**: Uses the full range of both datasets to calculate the Y-axis.
* **Interquartile Range (IQR)**: Uses the IQR method to exclude outliers and calculate the Y-axis range.
* **Force Same Axis**: Forces both datasets to use the same Y-axis, so no second axis will be rendered.

### Does the chart auto-refresh?

Yes, the chart refreshes automatically, following the update pattern of the respective Homey insight.

### How can I see more details about a specific data point in the chart?

To view more detailed information about a specific data point, simply click on it within the chart. A tooltip will appear with additional context for that data point.

### How do I close the tooltip?

To close the tooltip, click on either the horizontal (x-axis) or vertical (y-axis) axis, and the tooltip will disappear.
